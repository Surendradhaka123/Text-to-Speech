# Text-to-Speech Converter using SpeechT5 Model

The Text-to-Speech Converter using the SpeechT5 Model is a powerful tool that allows you to convert written text into natural-sounding speech. This repository contains the code and resources needed to run the SpeechT5 model, which is based on the T5 architecture and fine-tuned specifically for speech synthesis tasks.

## 1. Introduction

SpeechT5 is a state-of-the-art model designed for text-to-speech (TTS) applications. It leverages the T5 architecture, a versatile transformer model, and fine-tunes it on a large corpus of text-to-speech data to generate human-like speech from input text. The model can be used for various applications, including audiobook production, voice assistants, voiceovers for videos, and more.

This repository provides a pre-trained SpeechT5 model that can be used directly for TTS tasks. Additionally, it offers example scripts and instructions for fine-tuning the model on custom datasets for specific use cases.

## 2. Features

- High-quality and natural-sounding speech synthesis
- Easy-to-use interface for text-to-speech conversion
- Pre-trained model for immediate use
- Customizable and extensible for fine-tuning on custom datasets
- Compatible with Python 3.x

## 3. Installation

To use the SpeechT5 model, follow these steps for installation:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Surendradhaka123/Text-to-Speech.git
cd Text-to-Speech
```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## 4. Usage

For fine tunning or selecting the any specific voice by using speeker embeddings you can check-out `text_to_speech_Converter.ipynb`, here you will get the steps for fine-tuning and setting-up with speaker embeddings.

To help you get started, this repository includes a  Speech_app.py file. You can use this file to test the SpeechT5 model on different input texts.

Run the Speech_app.py file on your system and enter the text and you will get an audio file. You can also download this audio file. You can also read a .txt file a get the audio file for the same.

## 5. Model Architecture

The SpeechT5 model is based on the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) architecture. It uses a transformer encoder-decoder structure to process the input text and generate the corresponding speech waveform. The model is pre-trained on a large dataset of text-to-speech samples and fine-tuned to optimize speech synthesis performance.

For more details on the model architecture and training process, please refer to the [SpeechT5 paper](https://example.com/speecht5_paper).

## 6. Web App

- I have also developed a web app for the same and deployed it on the HuggingFace. You can check-out the web app by following the link. [Web App](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SurendraKumarDhaka/Text-to-speech-converter)
